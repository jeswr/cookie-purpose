 - For the most part it seems that purpose descriptions are *too different* to be doing any sort of similarity grouping up front
 - The API itself is quite inconsistent (when tested against the mini model)

Dataset:
 - The dataset contains
   - 4048205 distinct entries
   - 28296 distinct purpose descriptions. Hence we shall only analyse distinct purpose descriptions to start with
   - 27391 distinct purpose descriptions once normalized


 - Need to do rounds with experts in order to build up a corpus of evals
